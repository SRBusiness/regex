# Capstone Product Plan
### Sarah Read-Brown - Regex Browser Game

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__: A list outlining the major things that you want to focus on learning in this project.
  - Through building this project I would like to develop a foundational understanding of React.js
  - Gain more experience in project design and management
  - Learn more aspects of JavaScript ES6 and integrate that into my code
  - Have a better understanding of Regular expressions (regex)

1. __Problem Statement__: A regular expression (regex) is a pattern that attempts to match in input sting text and can be used for validating user input strings, search engines, search and replace dialogs of word processors and text editors. I've been interested in learning regex's but I've struggled to gain more than a basic understanding because many of the resources available online are not geared towards beginners or increase in difficulty too rapidly. I've enjoyed playing online browser games such as [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) and [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) to gain a better understanding of CSS concepts. To address the lack of beginner resources for learning regex I want to create an otter themed browser game to help user learn regex.

1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
    - Pre-Existing Regex Browser Games
      - [Regex Crossword](https://regexcrossword.com/) is a fun game that has many levels. I found their tutorial to be minimal and unhelpful to a novice. Additionally the level of difficulty of their Crossword puzzles scaled incredibly fast and I got stuck early on.
      - [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/)
      - [Regex Golf](http://www.alf.nu/RegexGolf)

    - Many of these games don't attempt to teach you regex and if they do their tutorial and materials are limited in scope or generally unhelpful. I played through as far as I could in these games found that the difficulty increased to rapidly. Additionally when I got stuck there wasn't any feedback or clues to help.
    - The best of the group was the RegexOne tutorials. I liked their site structure but again found that the difficulty in levels increased to rapidly. They had helpful solutions and great dynamic text highlighting.
    - Each of these sites had a very bland color scheme and UI.
    - differentiation: I would like to create a regex game that slowly introduces new concepts, that has lots of hint

1. __User Personas__: A summary of your main target user group(s). What are their key characteristics? How do those characteristics factor into project/app/idea?

1. __Trello Board__:
    - Flesh out the feature set that you created in the conceptual delivery to get started with your Trello board

1. __Technology selections__:
    - Front-end
      - JavaScript
      - React.js
      - React-Bootstrap
      - Possibly Redux
    - Back-end
      - Ruby On Rails API (if time allows)
    - Infrastructure
      - Webpack / NPM / Babel

1. __Wireframes__:
    - Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
